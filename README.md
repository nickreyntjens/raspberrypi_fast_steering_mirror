# raspberrypi_fast_steering_mirror

While commercial fast beam steering solutions exist, there is not a simple cheap solution available to the open source community. The project is part of the photonic insecticides movement (https://photonicinsecticides.com) which aims to prevent the extinction of insects.

## Very cheap version with toy servos (cost = 5 euro)

The 3D printable step files are available in this repo.
This mirror has an expected latency of 20ms (50 hertz pwm delay) + 1 ms (physical movement delay).

A faster version, with more expensive servos like these:

can hopefully be built in the near future, these would have a latency of 3 ms + 0.5 ms.
When modifying the servoÂ´s by removng the potentiometer and driving the motor directly, a latency of 0.5 ms may be possible.

First surface mirrors are recomended for good optical performence:

More advanced users may use ultra thin mirrors, making the inirtia small and leading to faster mirror movements.
